# Idea

## Research Question

> Can collisions be avoided by monitoring the driver's stress levels?

## Components

- The computer running the simulation
- Virtual Reality (VR) headset
- Sensors for stress levels
- (Durable) remote controlled car that can be controlled using a programmatic
  API

## Implementation

A car is controlled with a live view (using VR) from the driver's position.
Car speed is determined by monitoring driver stress levels.
