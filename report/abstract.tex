  Car accidents caused by human factors are among the main causes of injures
  in traffic. Stress makes drivers more prone to mistakes while driving. This
  report covers a project aimed at developing a way of smartly influencing car
  control based on driver stress levels, with the goal of avoid accidents.
  A simulation was built using a remote controlled car. In it, the driver
  is equipped with Galvanic Stress Response sensors and placed in a virtual
  car, which they are then tasked to control. The stress level of the driver
  was then used to determine the speed of the car. Future research would be
  necessary before the system can be adapted into actual vehicles.
