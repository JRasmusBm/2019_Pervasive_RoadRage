\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Road rage is a common phenomenon in traffic around the world. Human beings
are emotional, and it's not without reason to claim that humans can be
irrational given the right circumstances. Today's technology allows for
accurate measurements of stress and almost fully autonomous cars. Yet car
accidents related to stress are all too common.

This project aims to find a way of avoiding car accidents, based on stress
measurements of the car driver.
