# ShimmerPPGHRGSRConsoleAppExample
This example is to be used with a Shimmer3 GSR+ Sensor. It uses the ShimmerClosedLibrary dll to convert PPG readings into heart rate. Sensor data are printed to the console

- **Before using this example create the ShimmerAPI dll by building the ShimmerAPI project**

- **When using this example ensure that the reference to the ShimmerAPI dll is correct**

- This project uses the both the ShimmerClosedLibrary and MathNetNumerics library for the ppg to hr algorithm

- Note that the appropriate comport (Shimmer device) needs to be set in Program.cs before compiling/running the example
